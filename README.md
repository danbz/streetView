## How it works

By doing the call:

	http://cbk0.google.com/cbk?output=xml&panoid=[pano_id]&dm=1

We get information that looks like [this](http://maps.google.com/cbk?output=xml&cb_client=maps_sv&v=4&dm=1&hl=en&panoid=ki_KzVWkE87EgkPWg3QPXg) 

At <deptMap> you can seee a depth image encoded in base64 (and zlib compressed)

This addon will construct the panoramic image (that you can get with ```getTextureReference()``` ) and then construct a 3D Mesh using the DepthMap information.
